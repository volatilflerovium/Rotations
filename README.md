# Rotations
Rotations without matrix

Who needs matrices?!

This is a simple implementation of rotation without the use of matrices (the
algorithm is in vector_class2.h).

The red ball is rotating around rotation axis (0,0,1), while the green ball
is rotating the axis defined by the vector (7.0, -11.0, 8.0) and projecting
on the plane xy, therefore describing an elliptic orbit.
